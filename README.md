# Idea for codefundo++ - Wildfire(change the name of app here)
A wildfire detection and prediction application with facilities to contact for assistance

## Product description
The application being developed is for the detection of wildfires using live video feed. Video processing is a much faster way of fire detection than more simplistic approaches such as temperature changes as they can provide close to real time detection. This application would require hardware to record video feed from the forest and transmit it to the system. This portion is not implemented as a part of the application and hence, supply of video feed is to be taken care of by the user.
